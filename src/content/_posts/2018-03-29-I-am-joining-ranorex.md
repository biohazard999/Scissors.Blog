I'm very excited to announce I'm joining [Ranorex](https://www.ranorex.com/).
I'll spend my full time working on test automation software and building tools for developers all around the globe!

Of course I'll continue blogging on [DevExpress](https://www.devexpress.com/) and [XAF](https://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/Application_Framework/) related stuff, but I probably also blog more on test automation in the future.

I'm excited to work in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) most of my time, so there will be some posts on that as well.

With lovely greetings to all my readers and the whole DevExpress community,  
Manuel
